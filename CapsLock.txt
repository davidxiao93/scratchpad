Change CapsLock to behave as a Hyper key
Unlocks a new modifier to use for shortcuts

Gnome Tweak Tools 
- Keyboard & Mouse
- Additional Layout Options
- Caps Lock behaviour
- Make Caps Lock an additional Hyper

This will convert Caps Lock into a Hyper

If Hyper is being treated as Super then they are likely sharing the same mod level

Run 
  xmodmap
and check if Hyper_L is on the same line as Super_L
If they are, then they are acting the same way

Run 
  xmodmap -e "remove Mod4 = Hyper_L" -e "add Mod3 = Hyper_L"
to move Hyper_L from Mod4 to Mod3 in this example. Change as needed
