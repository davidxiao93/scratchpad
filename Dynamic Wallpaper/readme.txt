Grab precaptured large images from Google drive

Bash script can be used to resize all of them

Python script can be used to generate the gnome wallpaper xml

Use 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri-dark 'file:///home/david/.wallpaper/ForestDynamic/dynamic_wallpaper.xml'
to set the wallpaper

May need to relaunch Gnome to take effect

Note images from Google drive have duplicated midday (149, 150, 151)
